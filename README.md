# Reddit Bot plan 

- Level1: Make the bot to respond when summoned with a set of sayings being fetched from a file. (done)
- Level2: Use an api of quotes to fetch the sayings, if possible with the context. 
- Level3: Use an nlp model to understand the complete context of the comment instead of just summoning words. 
- Level4: Link the model to an llm (thinking llaama) so it can respond in the backend.
